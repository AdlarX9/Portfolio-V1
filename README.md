# Portfolio V1

## Overview

This project is my first portfolio, available at [`https://pifpafdeluxe.fr/`](https://pifpafdeluxe.fr/).

Its purpose is to redirect visitors to other websites I have created, which can be found listed here. \
Note that not all of them have a dedicated GitHub repository, as I believe some do not warrant one.

It is built with React and Vite, and can be run locally with:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
